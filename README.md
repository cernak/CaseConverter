# CaseConverter
<h1>About</h1>
<p>Project complete date: October 13, 2021.</p>
<p>We work with texts quite often, and it's very sad when it turns out that the text should have been written in a different case. Instead of editing it, I created created a simple application that does the job for us.</p>
<h2>Learning outcomes</h2>
<p>While implementing this project, I worked with basic HTML elements. Created event handlers for click events and worked with strings in JavaScript.</p>
